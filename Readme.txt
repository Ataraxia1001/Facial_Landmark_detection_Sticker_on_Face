This is repository for facial landmark detection project.
It is detecting and recognizing the facial landmark by testing various convolutional neural networks.
Input data is face images and ouput of model is x, y coordinates values(points) which determine the facial landmarks 
like the positions of eyes, noes, mouth, and so on. The output has 106 differents points on the face.
I'm constantly attempt to use better model with more complexity, but the computing power currently makes impasse to run a model with 
high FLOPs.

I need to make multiple scripts to do this project.
Mainly, the codes are divided as follow.

1. plotting the points on the face.(train data)

2. training neural network(CNN model)

3. testing the model with new image(test data)
