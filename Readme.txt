This is repository for facial landmark detection project.
It is detecting and recognizing the facial landmark by testing various convolutional neural networks.
Input data is face images and ouput of model is x, y coordinates values(points) which determine the facial landmarks 
like the positions of eyes, noes, mouth, and so on. The output has 106 differents points on the face.

I need to make multiple scripts to do this project.
Mainly the codes are divided as follow.

1. plotting the points on the face

2. training neural network

3. testing the model with new image
